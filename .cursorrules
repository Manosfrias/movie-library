# Movie Library - Coding Rules

## Import Rules
- ALWAYS use @/ for absolute imports within src/
- NEVER use relative imports like ../../../
- Exception: files outside src/ use relative paths when needed

## Code Style  
- Use functional programming over classes
- Export individual functions, not classes
- Prefer pure functions and immutability
- Avoid comments unless absolutely necessary - code should be self-documenting
- Use arrow functions for simple functions
- Use const over let when possible

## Architecture
- Follow hexagonal architecture pattern
- Use Repository pattern for data access
- Use Factory functions over constructors
- Keep domain logic separate from infrastructure

## TypeScript
- Use proper typing, avoid any
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use type for unions and aliases

## File Organization
- Group related functionality in folders
- Use index.ts for clean exports
- Keep files focused on single responsibility
